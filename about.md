<p>Dr Camelia Quek is a Cancer Institute NSW Early Career Fellow at Melanoma Institute Australia, Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the University of Sydney, and Steering Committee at the Cancer Research Network. Dr Quek originally did a first degree in molecular biology at the University of New South Wales (University Medal in Molecular Biology) before moving on to do a PhD in genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Melbourne (Sawyer Medal). Dr Quek is a Clinical Computational Biologist who is an expert in the integration and interpretation of high-dimensional data obtained from cancer patients, and uses these discoveries to address most pressing questions in the field. Dr Quek’s early research has made significant advances in understanding cancer biology and tumour microenvironment in melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy, using gene expression profiles to discover biomarkers in response to cancer therapies, and single-cell multi-omics to guide clinical decision-making.</p>
<p>Her research impact and contributions are recognised in Australia and worldwide. Over the past years, she has received several prestigious awards including 2022 CINSW Premier’s Awards for Wildfire Highly Cited Publication (co-first authors, Cancer Cell 2019), 2021 10x Millennium Science Start Single Cell Award, and 2017 CINSW Premier’s Awards for Excellence in Translational Research Team. She has also received 3X Best Poster Winner 2014, 2017 and 2018, and Best Oral Talk 2017 at both international and national conferences.</p>

Dr Quek’s research program focuses on understanding the immunogenic expression profiles in patients treated with cancer therapies, key proteins and biological mechanisms driving cellular identity and heterogeneity within tumour and immune microenvironment, particularly in the context of biomarker, drug resistance, druggable targets and how tumour heterogeneity shapes disease progression. Her current research interests are: (1) Biomarkers of response and resistance to cancer therapies, (2) Single-cell multi-omics to understand treatment and progression, and (3) Spatial imaging to dissect key cellular interactions and novel drug targets.

Aside from research, Dr Quek is appointed as an Associate Editor in Molecular Carcinogenesis (2023 - Present), Review Editor at Frontiers (2021 - Present), Special Issue Editor (2021 - Present) in International Journal of Molecular Sciences (IJMS), and as well as Genes. She is also a frequent reviewer for Nature, BMC Cancer, IJMS, Frontiers in Oncology, and Frontiers in Digital Health. In addition, Dr Quek is an Ambassador (2017 - Present) for European Association of Cancer Research. For teaching, she is a PhD thesis examiner, and a leading supervisor for several Honours and PhD students, and chairs PhD progress evaluation meeting. Furthermore, Dr Quek is a co-investigator in Data Access Committee, where sequencing data generated for the purposes of biomedical, clinical and translational research projects are frequently deposited and shared in TCGA, ENA and EGA so that researchers can undertake similar studies worldwide.
